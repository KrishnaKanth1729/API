## üèÅ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [Running with Docker](#-running-with-docker) if you want to setup the API faster with Docker.

### Discord application

Create a new Discord application [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications) by clicking the `New application` button and name it whatever you want.

![New application](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/721750194797936823/794646477505822730/unknown.png)

Now that you have an application, go to the OAuth2 tab.

![OAuth2 tab](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/721750194797936823/794648158272487435/unknown.png)

And add `http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/discord/callback` to the redirects.

![Redirects](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/721750194797936823/798276213776318494/unknown.png)

### Prerequisites

Install Pipenv:

```sh
pip install pipenv
```

Install the required packages and the packages for development with Pipenv:

```sh
pipenv install --dev
```

### Environment variables

#### Required

Start by writing this in a file named `.env`:

```prolog
REDIS_URI=
SECRET_KEY=
POSTGRES_URI=
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

And fill in the variables with the values below:

- `REDIS_URI` is the Redis server URI.
- `SECRET_KEY` is the key used for JWT token encoding.
- `POSTGRES_URI` is the PostgreSQL database URI.
- `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` is the Discord application ID. Copy it from your Discord application page (see below).
- `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` is the Discord application secret. Copy it from your Discord application page (see below).

![Client ID and secret](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/721750194797936823/794646777840140298/unknown.png)

#### Optional

For testing you need to add these environment variables:

- `TEST_REDIS_URI` is the Connection URI for Redis testing server.
- `TEST_POSTGRES_URI` is the PostgreSQL database URI for tests.

If you are self hosting the Piston API, you need to set the `PISTON_URL` environment variable.

### Running

Run the API and initialise the database:

#### Make sure submodules are up to date.
> If you have not initialized submodules use this command:\
> `git submodule update --init`
>
> To update submodules:\
> `git submodule foreach git pull`

```sh
pipenv run python launch.py runserver --initdb
```

The API should run at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000). For more information about the CLI, check the docs [here](/docs/cli.md).

## üê≥ Running with Docker

Both the API and the [frontend](https://github.com/Tech-With-Tim/Frontend) can be started using Docker. Using Docker is generally recommended (but not strictly required) because it abstracts away some additional set up work.

- Setup the discord app like done [here](#discord-application).

- Make a file named `.env` like done [here](#environment-variables). You don't need the DB_URI environment variable though.

- Then make sure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed, if not read [this for docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [this for docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

- Deploy the API:

  ```sh
  docker-compose up --build api
  ```

## ‚úÖ Linting

We use a pre-commit hook for linting the code before each commit. Set up the pre-commit hook:

```sh
pipenv run pre-commit install
```

If you want to run the pre-commit checks before trying to commit, you can do it with:

```sh
pipenv run lint
```

## üö® Tests

To test the API, we use the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) framework to make sure that the code we write works.

Run the tests:

```sh
pipenv run test
```

**When you contribute, you need to add tests on the features you add.**
